      <p>A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems.
        A galaxy is held together by gravity.
        Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a supermassive black hole in the middle.
        <br /><br />
        There are many galaxies besides ours, though.
        There are so many, we can't even count them all yet!
        The Hubble Space Telescope looked at a small patch of space for 12 days and found 10,000 galaxies, of all
        sizes, shapes, and colors.
        Some scientists think there could be as many as one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.
        <br /><br />
        Some galaxies are spiral-shaped like ours. They have curved arms that make it look like a pinwheel.
        Other galaxies are smooth and oval shaped. They're called elliptical galaxies.
        And there are also galaxies that aren't spirals or ovals.
        They have irregular shapes and look like blobs.
        The light that we see from each of these galaxies comes from the stars inside it.

          <h3>Spiral Galaxy</h3>
          <p>Spiral galaxies have two distinct regions.
            The disk of the galaxy contains the spiral arms.
            The disk is a region of star formation and has a great deal of gas and dust.
            It is dominated by young, blue Population I stars which includes sun and tend to be luminous, hot and
            young, concentrated in the disks of spiral galaxies.
            The central bulge is devoid of gas and dust.

          <h3>Elliptical Galaxy</h3>
          <p>Elliptical galaxies have very little gas and dust. Because gas and dust are found in the
            clouds that are the birthplaces of stars, we should expect to see very few young stars in
            elliptical galaxies. In fact, elliptical galaxies contain
            primarily old, red stars (also known as Population II stars).Elliptical galaxies vary widely
            in size. Both the largest and the smallest known galaxies are elliptical.
            ery large elliptical galaxies can reach 300 million light years in diameter.</p>

          <h3>Irregular Galaxy</h3>
          <p>Galaxies that do not fit into either the spiral or elliptical classes are called irregular galaxies.
            Irregular galaxies have a wide variety of shapes and characteristics.
            They are frequently the result of collisions between galaxies or gravitational interactions
            between galaxies.</p>
