        <h1>Birth of Universe</h1>
        <h3 class="sub">According to the Boshongo people of central Africa, in the beginning, there
            was only darkness, water, and the great god Bumba. One day Bumba, in pain from a stomach
            ache, vomited up the sun. The sun dried up some of the water, leaving land.
            Still in pain, Bumba vomited up the moon, the stars, and then some animals.
            The leopard, the crocodile, the turtle, and finally, man. </h3>
        <p class="sub">The universe was born with the Big Bang as an unimaginably hot, dense point.
            When the universe was just 10-34 of a second or so old — that is, a hundredth of a billionth
            of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second in age — it experienced an incredible burst
            of expansion known as inflation, in which space itself expanded faster than the speed of light.
            During this period, the universe doubled in size at least 90 times, going from
            subatomic-sized to golf-ball-sized almost instantaneously.
            <br /> <br />
            The work that goes into understanding the expanding universe comes from a combination
            of theoretical physics and direct observations by astronomers.
            However, in some cases astronomers have not been able to see direct
            evidence — such as the case of gravitational waves associated with the cosmic microwave
            background, the leftover radiation from the Big Bang. A preliminary announcement about
            finding these waves in 2014 was quickly retracted, after astronomers found the signal
            detected could be explained by dust in the Milky Way.
            <br /> <br />
            According to NASA, after inflation the growth of the
            universe continued, but at a slower rate. As space expanded, the universe cooled and matter formed. One
            second after the Big Bang, the universe was filled with neutrons, protons, electrons, anti-electrons,
            photons and neutrinos.
            <br /> <br />
            In the first three minutes of the universe, the light elements were born during a process known as Big
            Bang nucleosynthesis. Temperatures cooled from 100 nonillion (1032) Kelvin to 1 billion (109) Kelvin, and
            protons and neutrons collided to make deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. Most of the deuterium combined to
            make helium, and trace amounts of lithium were also generated.
            <br /> <br />
            For the first 380,000 years or so, the universe was essentially too hot for light to shine, according to
            France's National Center of Space Research (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, or CNES). The heat of
            creation smashed atoms together with enough force to break them up into a dense plasma, an opaque soup of
            protons, neutrons and electrons that scattered light like fog.
            <br /> <br />
            Roughly 380,000 years after the Big Bang, matter cooled enough for atoms to form during the era of
            recombination, resulting in a transparent, electrically neutral gas, according to NASA. This set loose the
            initial flash of light created during the Big Bang, which is detectable today as cosmic microwave
            background radiation. However, after this point, the universe was plunged into darkness, since no stars or
            any other bright objects had formed yet.
            <br /> <br />
            About 400 million years after the Big Bang, the universe began to emerge from the cosmic dark ages during
            the epoch of reionization. During this time, which lasted more than a half-billion years, clumps of gas
            collapsed enough to form the first stars and galaxies, whose energetic ultraviolet light ionized and
            destroyed most of the neutral hydrogen.
            <br /> <br />
            Although the expansion of the universe gradually slowed down as the matter in the universe pulled on itself
            via gravity, about 5 or 6 billion years after the Big Bang, according to NASA, a mysterious force now
            called dark energy began speeding up the expansion of the universe again, a phenomenon that continues
            today.
            <br /> <br />
            A little after 9 billion years after the Big Bang, our solar system was born.
