      <h1>Birth of Universe</h1>
      <h3 class="sub">According to the Boshongo people of central Africa, in the beginning, there
        was only darkness, water, and the great god Bumba. One day Bumba, in pain from a stomach
        ache, vomited up the sun. The sun dried up some of the water, leaving land.
        Still in pain, Bumba vomited up the moon, the stars, and then some animals.
        The leopard, the crocodile, the turtle, and finally, man. </h3>
      <p class="describ">The universe was born with the Big Bang as an unimaginably hot, dense point.
        When the universe was just 10-34 of a second or so old — that is, a hundredth of a billionth
        of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second in age — it experienced an incredible burst
        of expansion known as inflation, in which space itself expanded faster than the speed of light.
        During this period, the universe doubled in size at least 90 times, going from
        subatomic-sized to golf-ball-sized almost instantaneously.
        <br /><br />
        The work that goes into understanding the expanding universe comes from a combination
        of theoretical physics and direct observations by astronomers.
        However, in some cases astronomers have not been able to see direct
        evidence — such as the case of gravitational waves associated with the cosmic microwave
        background, the leftover radiation from the Big Bang. A preliminary announcement about
        finding these waves in 2014 was quickly retracted, after astronomers found the signal
        detected could be explained by dust in the Milky Way.</p>
